# Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Lance Cav

If you use a token from **Xaro Xhoan Daxos** on a Lance Cav attacking you, to lower his rank by 1, how many dice will a charging **Lance Cav** roll?
:::tip[Depends]

**It depends** on how many ranks the Cav has, since you lower the ranks only for the normal attack rules, not for the Lance Ability.

So if the Cav has **2** ranks, it will roll 8 dice.

If the Cav has **1** rank (and you used Xaro token for literally nothing), it will roll 6 dice.
