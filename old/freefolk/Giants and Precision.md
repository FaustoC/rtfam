# How does Furious Swing works togheter with Precision?


:::warning[It doesn't]

**It doesn't**, you have to choose one, it's a grey area but hear me out.


RAW a giant with *Furious Swing* and *Precision* rolling one 6 means, for *Precision*, that he opponent doesn't roll defense dice and get 1 wound **instead** of rolling defense dice, while for *Furious Swing* he has generated hits (one) and deals X wound (X=D3+wounds on giant) **instead** of rolling defense dice. 

Now we have two effect working **instead** of something, and being instead an **alternative/substitute**, both effects cannot apply to the same defense roll, cause the moment you apply one of the effects then you dont have a defense roll anymore and you can't apply the other one.
