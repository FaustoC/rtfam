# How does Pyke Aggression and Boldness and Courage combo?

They almost don't. The **B&C** second part of the ability get's overruled by the **Pyke Aggression** limitation on "Melee Attack using it's lowest Attack Die value".

:::warning[It depends]

**It depends**, here is the scheme based on the rank of the attacking unit which has B&C and uses Pyke Aggression : 

1 rank - lowest dice value
2 rank - lowest dice value
3 rank - lowest dice value +1 additional dice
