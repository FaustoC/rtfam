# Can i use Adaptive Planning and change a condition Token to one i already have?

Can you use **Adaptive Planning** and change a condition Token on a unit, to become a condition Token i already have?

Yes the result would be that from 2 condition Tokens you'll end up with only one, cause you would lose the second condition Token, being it the same type as one you already have.


:::tip[YES]

**YES**, you would then lose it, resulting in a unit with only one condition Token.
