# Olenna Tyrell and Robb Stark

Can you use **Pulling Weeds** from Olenna Tyrell NCU to clear Robb Stark's card **Wolf's Cunning**?

:::danger[NO]

**NO** you can't. 

But for better understanding **YES you can, BUT** it wont change a thing, cause the zone effect (that is replaced by **Wolf's Cunning**) is the one granting the bonus, not the card that is just put there as a reminder.
