# Walder Frey and Walder Frey

If both players activate the third effect of Walder Frey, who *then* becomes first player the next round?


:::tip[The non active player at the stard of the round]

**The non active player at the stard of the round** becomes the first player.

Start of round effects are resolved, as all effects, in order of first player and then non first player.<br/>
So if both players declared Walder, the player that starts the round with First Player token would resolve the effect first<br/>
His walder would do nothing, as he's already the first player.<br/>
Then, the other player would resolve his Walder and become the First player.
