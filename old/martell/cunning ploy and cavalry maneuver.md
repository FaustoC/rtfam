# How does Cunning Ploy interact with Cavalry maneuver?


If you use **Cunning Ploy**  when you activate a Cavalry unit, do you get to do the Cavalry maneuver?

:::warning[Need an FAQ]

The majority of players play this as **NO you cant**.

We **need an FAQ**, cause it is not clear at all if **Cunning Ploy** and the **Cavalry ability** share the same trigger (if that was the case, yes you could target the cav unit and still do his maneuver since you decide the order of resolution of your abilities).

If we look on the FAQ for Season 4 we have this : 

UNCONTROLLED RAGE<br/>
Errata: Each time this unit Activates, if it can Charge an enemy, it<br/>
performs 1 Morale Test. On a failure, it performs 1 Charge Action<br/>
on the nearest valid enemy and counts as rolling a 6 for all Charge<br/>
Distance Dice (this is their Action for the Turn).<br/>
Q: Can a Cavalry unit with Uncontrolled Rage perform the free<br/>
Maneuver Action first?<br/>
A: No.<br/>

The trigger for **Uncontrolled Rage** is the same as **Cunning Ploy** so we can assume that the answer in the FAQ counts for Cunning Ploy too?
