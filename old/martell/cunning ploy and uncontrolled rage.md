# How does Cunning Ploy interact with Uncontrolled Rage from Obara Sand?


If you use **Cunning Ploy** when you activate a unit with Obara Sand Sand Snake attachment, do you get to do the **Uncontrolled Rage** ability?

:::warning[Need an FAQ]

The majority of players play this as **NO you cant**.

We **need an FAQ**, cause it is not clear at all if **Cunning Ploy** and **Uncontrolled Rage** share the same trigger (if that was the case, yes you could target Obara's unit and still do his **Uncontrolled Rage** ability since you decide the order of resolution of your abilities).

If we look on the FAQ for Season 4 we have this : 

UNCONTROLLED RAGE<br/>
Errata: Each time this unit Activates, if it can Charge an enemy, it<br/>
performs 1 Morale Test. On a failure, it performs 1 Charge Action<br/>
on the nearest valid enemy and counts as rolling a 6 for all Charge<br/>
Distance Dice (this is their Action for the Turn).<br/>
Q: Can a Cavalry unit with Uncontrolled Rage perform the free<br/>
Maneuver Action first?<br/>
A: No.<br/>

The trigger for **Cavalry ability** is the same as **Cunning Ploy** so we can assume that the answer in the FAQ counts for Cunning Ploy too?
