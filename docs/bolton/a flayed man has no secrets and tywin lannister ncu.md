# A Flayed Man Has No Secrets and Tywin Lannister NCU

If **A Flayed Man Has No Secrets** is played to cancel **Tywin's Rains of Castamere** effect, can Tywin's ability be played on another turn, or is it considered as already used?


:::tip[YES]

**YES**, you can use **Tywin's Rains of Castamere** on another turn.
Since the Season 4 FAQ all the targets of an ability needs to be pre-declared, even if there are prerequisites to use that ability, so in the target declaration **A Flayed Man Has No Secrets** can cancel the whole effect, even the "Once per game" part of **Tywin's Rains of Castamere**.
