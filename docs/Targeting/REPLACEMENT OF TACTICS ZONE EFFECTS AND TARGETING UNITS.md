# REPLACEMENT OF TACTICS ZONE EFFECTS AND TARGETING UNITS  

###  If an ability or tactics card replaces a Zone effect on the tactics board does the combat unit targeted count as being targeted by the ability/tactics card in question?  

No. The unit in question is being targeted by the zone and its effect - not the tactics card/ability.  

**EXAMPLES:**
NCU Roose Bolton – Calculating and Cruel activates and claims a Zone on the tactics board. The owning player replaces the Zone effect using the Horrific Rumors ability and targets an enemy combat unit that is being influenced by Barristan Selmy – Advisor to the Dragon. Can the Wisdom of the Old Knight ability block the panic test?  
**NO** – as the zone effect (even though it has been changed to Horrific Rumors) is not an “Ability or Tactics card”. 


A Lannister player activates an NCU and claims a Zone on the tactics board. The owning player replaces the Zone effect using the tactics card Bribery and targets an enemy combat unit being influenced by Eddard Stark – Hand of the King. Can the Stark player use the Hand’s Orders ability to cancel the effect? 
**YES** – as even though the zone effect has been changed by the tactics card Bribery it is still a zone effect.
