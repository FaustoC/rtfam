# TARGETING “BASICS”

#### When are units considered to be targeted by an effect? 


 There are four conditions that determine targeting. If at least 1 of these conditions is true, 	then the unit is a target of the effect.
1. The effect explicitly states that the unit is targeted.
2. The unit was chosen from a set of possible options (even if there was only one legal option at the time you chose).
3. The effect is an Order of the unit itself.
4. The effect is an Order or Tactics card, and the unit triggers that Order or Tactics card (meaning: the unit is the subject of the trigger sentence).


#### Can an effect have multiple targets? 

Yes. They don't need to satisfy the same test. One section may say target, and another says choose. Both sections therefore target for different reasons. 
**EXAMPLES:**
**Sudden Retreat** Triggers off an enemy unit completing an attack, (subject of trigger) and in the effect states "Target the Defender", therefore the Attacker and Defender are targeted. (1, 4) 
**Raiding Call** "Remove up to 3 models and up to 1 Pillage token from 1 other friendly Greyjoy Infantry unit in Long Range". That unit is targeted, even if only 1 legal option is in range, because you can possibly choose it. Additionally the receiving unit is the subject of the trigger and is targeted. (2, 4)
**Lash Out** does not target the Defender, because you can't choose the Defender of the Attack. The only target is the attacking unit, which is the subject of the trigger. (4)
**Order: Set for Charge** the unit using the order is targeted by that Order. (3)
**Order: Sentinel** "After another friendly unit in Long Range is Attacked" The friendly unit is the subject of the trigger sentence, so it is targeted. Additionally the unit using Order: Sentinel is a target, as it is an order of the unit itself. (3, 4) 
**Fire made Flesh** "When an enemy Attacks a friendly Drogon, Rhaegal, or Viserion unit, after rolling Defense Dice:" The enemy is the subject of the trigger, so it is a target. Even though Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion are mentioned in the trigger, they are not the subjects, therefore are not targeted.

#### Can I target Combat units that are not on the battlefield (such as Combat Units in Reserve) with Abilities/effects?

No.
