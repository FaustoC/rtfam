# TARGETING TIMING

### When exactly do I declare targets of effects?

You need to declare all targets immediately before you resolve the effect. Additionally, you must check that targets which are defined by the trigger (see 4. above) are legal targets when you declare the effect.
**Example:**
For simultaneous actions, the active player declares all of their effects, checking if the target from the trigger is legal (this doesn't count as targeting yet). Then the passive player will do the same. Once all effects have been declared by both players, the active player will resolve their effects one by one. Immediately before each effect, they will declare all targets, and then resolve the effect. Once the active player has resolved all of their effects, the passive player will follow.

*Yes, this is extremely complicated. This is our best understanding of how to comply with the ‘pre-targeting’ FAQ response/rulebook errata. Sorry.*
