# FIRE AND BLOOD

### What happens if a Marked Unit is redeployed in the “Fire & Blood” scenario?


The unit is redeployed in the exact same state as it was deployed the first time (no condition tokens are kept, unit is no longer Marked). Notably, Once Per Game abilities that have been already utilized cannot be used again, and orders that have been used that round may not be used again.

###  In Fire and Blood, do I gain +1 additional Victory Point if my Marked unit destroys an enemy that typically would not grant VP?

 Yes. The VP is being gained from the Marked unit, not the enemy.

###  In Fire and Blood, can you mark units that are in Outflank?

No.
