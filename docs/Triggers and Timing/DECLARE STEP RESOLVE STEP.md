# DECLARE STEP, RESOLVE STEP

### When do actions resolve? The only reference to resolving is in regards to attacks and some other game effects. What about a March Action?

The declare step for ALL ACTIONS is only the part where a player announces that a Unit will be performing said action. Some actions require you to declare targets, you must announce them at that time. Basically, declare is the step where you say what you will do, and as soon as you start doing it, you are in the resolve portion. The text on page 16, “resolving attacks” should be treated as being titled “the attack sequence.”
