# START OF ROUND/END OF ROUND

###  If 2 players declare effects that trigger at the Start of Round, which effect triggers first?

The first player's effects trigger first.

###  Does the “Start of a Round” share a trigger with the start of the first turn of the round? 

 "Start of Round" and "Start of any Turn" do not share a trigger. Start of round effects are declared and resolved before beginning the first turn of the round. 


###  How do you determine who has priority for declaring/resolving effects when declaring/resolving “start of round” abilities/cards?

Whichever player is taking the first turn that round (the player with the ‘first player token’ has priority for the “start of round” trigger.) 

### Who has priority at the end of round during the cleanup phase? 

At the end of the game round, whichever player holds the ‘first player token’ has priority in the cleanup phase.
