# ACTIVATE

### Are “When/Each Time a Unit Activates” and “At the start of This Unit’s Activation” the same trigger?


No. ‘When a Unit Activates’ is when it is selected as the unit to activate. At the start of the activation is immediately following, before the unit selects its action but once it has successfully activated and all on activation triggers have resolved.
