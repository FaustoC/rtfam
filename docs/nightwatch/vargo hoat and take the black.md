# Vargo Hoat & Take The Black

If you use **Sadistic Mutilation** from Vargo Hoat card to kill an enemy infantry attachment, can you then play **Take the Black** and get the attachment?

:::danger[NO]

**NO**, the wound from the destroyed infantry attachment it's outside the attack, being it completed. So it is destroyed, but not by the attack that Take the Black reference.

Nearly the same logic used on Final Strike.
