# It Shall Not End Until My Death and Panic test

If you use **It Shall Not End Until My Death** and destroy the attacker, remaining alive with 1 wound, do you need to perform a Panic test?

:::tip[YES]

**YES**, the attack sequence that almost killed you continues and that requires a Panic test since you received wounds (yes even if you had only 1 wound left before the attack).
