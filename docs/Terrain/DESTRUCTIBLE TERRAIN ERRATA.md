# DESTRUCTIBLE TERRAIN ERRATA

#### When attacking a terrain with the "Destructible" keyword, can you use abilities that work during the attack? (E.g., rally cry before rolling dice).


No. Community Errata: Treat destructible in the rulebook as reading: 
DESTRUCTIBLE: While within 1" of this Terrain piece, units may declare a Melee Attack Action targeting it, but instead as their action destroy this Terrain piece removing it from play. (This is not an Attack Action.)
