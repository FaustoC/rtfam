# CHARGES AND TERRAIN

### When charging, do I need to count the effects of Terrain pieces in advance of my unit actually coming in contact with them?

No. Community Errata: Ignore the official FAQ entry on page 2 of the official CMON FAQ. Only once your tray touches the Terrain piece do you suffer any Terrain Keywords.
