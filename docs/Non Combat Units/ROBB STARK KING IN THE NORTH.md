# ROBB STARK, KING IN THE NORTH

###  After Robb King in the North deploys a unit, he attaches his card to it, granting additional effects when charging. What happens if Robb loses his abilities after the unit have been already deployed? Does it turn off the attached Robb card?

The ability that Robb has is is a zone replacement effect, meaning that once the zone resolves, it resolves. It cannot be later turned off. Attached card just serves as a reminder that the unit has been deployed, it doesn't work same way as influences work.
