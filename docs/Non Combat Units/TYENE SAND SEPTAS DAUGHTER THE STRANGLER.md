# TYENE SAND, SEPTA’S DAUGHTER: THE STRANGLER


###  If The Strangler is present on a zone and Tyene has lost her abilities, does The Strangler still attach to an enemy NCU that claims that zone?

Yes.


### If Cressen uses his Sacrifice for the King Ability to activate at the start of a round and claim the zone with The Strangler present on it, does he still die at the end of the round?

Yes. His ability has been declared and fully resolved before claiming the card and losing his abilities.



### Follow up: Same question but instead it's Gilly claiming the zone with The Strangler.

 No. Her ability has two distinct triggers, rather than a single resolved effect. Because of this, at the end of the round she no longer has an ability that checks and looks for the presence of an Order token on her card.
