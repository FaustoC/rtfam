# PATCHFACE, PATCHES: MISUNDERSTOOD OMENS

###  If I declare Patchface when I am First Player that round, and my opponent declares a “start of round” card, when I resolve Patchface may I force him to discard the card he declared?

No, When a card is triggered/declared, it is played and is no longer in your hand. 


###  Follow up: If I declare Patchface and a start of round card, am I able to declare Counterplot as Patchface’s choice and force them to discard it before they use counterplot to stop my start of round card?


Yes. Counterplot states it triggers when an opponent plays a tactics card, before resolving the card. In general a trigger is not met until every part of it is fulfilled, and the last game event is the timing of that ability. In this case, counterplot is technically still in their hand, so you may remove it with patchface by resolving that ability before your tactics card.
