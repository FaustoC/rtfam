# DAVOS SEAWORTH, HAND OF THE TRUE KING: SMUGGLER’S CUNNING

### When performing a Charge, can you use more than one Davos NCU tokens to reroll the charge distance dice additional times?

No, the "after rolling charge distance dice" step occurs only once in the charge sequence. Davos NCU's ability to reroll dice can be used only once - there's only one trigger in which you can declare it.

Please also remember that any die can be rerolled by a player a maximum of one time - even if a player gains additional charge distance dice rerolls, there is no possibility to reroll that die more than once
