# OLENNA TYRELL, QUEEN OF THORNS: PULLING WEEDS

### If she uses her Ability on an NCU that has had an Ability resolve earlier in the Round, what happens?


If an Ability has already been triggered and resolved (such as a Once-per-game that has already been activated that Round) the effect remains in play.

###  If Olenna causes a NCU to lose all Abilities but that NCU is Influencing a unit, is the Influence removed?

No, the Influence remains in play but it ceases to have any other effect.
