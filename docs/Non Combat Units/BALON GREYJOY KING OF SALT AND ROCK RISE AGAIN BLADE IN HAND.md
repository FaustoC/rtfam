# BALON GREYJOY, KING OF SALT AND ROCK: RISE AGAIN, BLADE IN HAND

### Balon NCU vs Intrigue and Subterfuge. What is the precise timing of Balon's ability? Will it be resolved before Intrigue and Subterfuge?


The Active Player's effects resolve first, therefore Balon's ability almost always resolves first. 




### Are Attachments returned with his Ability?


Yes. 




### Does a unit with To The Last ability return to life with any tokens for this ability when re-deployed using Balon NCU?

 No, the unit is re-deployed identical to how they were initially deployed, outside of specifically mentioned effects such as pillage tokens from Balon NCU. To The Last tokens are added to a unit at the start of the game, thus not appearing when deployed, whether or not the unit still had any when destroyed.




### When Balon redeploys a unit with a rule that says it "deploys with X Pillage tokens, do they benefit from that ability? 


Yes. For example, Iron Victory Crew redeploys with 1 pillage token (if they contain the proper attachment for their ability.) Any Greyjoy unit containing Euron Greyjoy, Crow's Eye redeploys with 2 pillage tokens.
