# PETYR BAELISH, LITTLEFINGER: MASTER OF THE GAME

###  If "Master of the Game" is used at the start of the Round, and Petyr later loses all Abilities, what happens?

"Master of the Game" has already been utilized. It will remain in effect that round.

###  Follow-up: Does this apply even if Petyr Baelish used his once per game ability to count as controlling Water Gardens?


Yes.


###  What happens if neither player controls Water Gardens, but both of them use Petyr Baelish once per game ability to count as controlling Water Gardens?

Neither player counts as controlling any zone.
