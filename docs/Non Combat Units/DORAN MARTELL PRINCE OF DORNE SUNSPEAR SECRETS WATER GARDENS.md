# DORAN MARTELL: PRINCE OF DORNE, SUNSPEAR SECRETS, WATER GARDENS

### When Doran replaces the effect of the Water Gardens, can you spend multiple tokens to do the same effect more than once?

No.
 
### If, as the last Activation of the Round, I Claim Water Gardens, must my opponent Activate a Combat Unit as his first Activation of the next Round?

 Yes.
 
### If I Control Water Gardens, does Joffrey still count as Controlling the Crown zone?

 No.
 
### Follow-up: And the Petyr Baelish once per game Ability, does it count as Controlling the selected Zone?

No. Please note, this specific interaction takes priority over Petyr's FAQ entry and shuts down his once per game Ability.
