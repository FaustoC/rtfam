# SELYSE AND SHIREEN, QUEEN AND PRINCESS: NECESSARY SACRIFICES

###  Can a Baratheon player use Selyse and Shireen – Queen and Princess’ NCU ability Necessary Sacrifices if the second To the Last! Attempt fails?

Yes.  Note: If the first To The Last fails, a second should be used before resolving Necessary Sacrifices. To The Last is not an optional ability and must be resolved when that unit would be destroyed.
