# DONAL NOYE, EXPERT BLACKSMITH: EXPERT MAINTENANCE

### Donal NCU. When exactly his tokens are used. Can you block the use of Weakened tokens?

All effects allowing to re-roll Attack/Defence dice are used in the “Apply attack/defense dice rerolls” step BEFORE “after attack/defense dice are rolled” step. Active players resolve their effect first, so in the NW player's turn Donal's ability will be resolved before using the Weakened token.
