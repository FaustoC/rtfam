# Precision and Resilience

How does **Precision** works with **Resilience** ?

As any auto-wound/wound would. It doesn't.

:::danger[RESILIENCE DOESN'T BLOCK PRECISION]

**Resilience** does not block wounds, only unblocked hits.

**Example** :<br/>
An attack with **Precision** deals 2 wounds (from 2 dice being of value 6) and 3 hit.

The defender activate **Resilience** and rolls 3 dice to defends from the hits, and only fails 1.

The attack deals 2 wounds for the **Precision** and 0 wounds for the remaining undefended hit thanks to **Resilience** (1/2 = 0).
