# Target and Targeting

## When is something targeting a unit?

There are 4 (four) ways to target a unit, if your case fall in at least 1 (one) of those, then your case is targeting at least a unit.

*The only 4 ways to target a unit* :
- if a **unit is mentioned in the trigger** of the order/tactic card, that unit is targeted.
- if **the unit uses an order**, that unit is targeted by that order
- if **the text of the order/ability says "target"** *something*, then that *something* is targeted.
- if **there is a choice between units**, then the chosen unit/units are targeted.
