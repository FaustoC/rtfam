# How does Arya Stark and Coordination Tactics interact?

If you copy **Arya Stark** ability on another friendly unit, with **Coordination Tactics**, can you use the token on the Arya Stark card with the unit that copied his ability?

:::warning[Need an FAQ]

Some players rule it as **yes you can**, while others bring an example of other rules like those about pillage tokens as a **no you can't**.

We need an FAQ.
