# MIGHT OF THE THRONE/ORDERS OF THE CROWN/MOTIVATED BY COIN


Abilities similar to "Motivated by Coin" in this case, “Might of the Throne” and "Orders of the Crown” should have their replace effects read as follows: "1 friendly unit with [ ability name ] performs..." inline with the recent change to Motivated by Coin.


### Can Intercept Orders be used to prevent these abilities? 

Intercept Orders can only prevent these abilities in the case that there is another valid target of the replacement effect, i.e. there are multiple Motivated by Coin units on the battlefield that are all able to perform an Attack Action. (Note that if these effects do not include the word "may," new targets must be able to perform the required action for Intercept Orders to work.)
