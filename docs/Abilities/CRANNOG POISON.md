# CRANNOG POISON

### How many times can I attach "Crannog Poison" to enemy units?

Infinite. But remember that multiple instances of the same ability does not stack.

### Can I use [Wealth] to remove an instance of "Crannog Poison" on a friendly unit?

Yes.



### Am I able to remove "Crannog Poison" if the unit affected by it doesn't have any Condition tokens?

Yes.



### Can I use "Stag's Wit" to avoid "Crannog Poison" to be attached to a unit?

No.



### Follow up: When a unit with "Crannog Poison", previously attached, gains a Condition token, can I use "Stag's Wit" to remove the "Crannog Poison" instead?

Yes.
