# OUTRIDER'S BOW

### If I gain an Attack from an outside source (such as the Combat Zone) do I gain the benefits of Outrider's Bow?

Outrider's Bow checks for the Turn, not the Round. If the unit has not performed the Maneuver from Cavalry that Turn then they gain the benefits (which is most likely the case in these situations).
