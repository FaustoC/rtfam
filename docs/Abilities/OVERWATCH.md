# OVERWATCH

### If an enemy unit ends a move in Long Range of a friendly unit with Overwatch but the friendly unit only has a Short Range Attack, can they perform their Ranged Attack? 

No.


### If a unit ignores Line of Sight, do I still need to meet the Line of Sight requirement to trigger Overwatch?

Yes, Overwatch's trigger is independent of any other abilities on the unit.
