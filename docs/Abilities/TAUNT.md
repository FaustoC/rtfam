# TAUNT

### Does "Taunt" still trigger if I use the Cavalry Free Maneuver to position the Cavalry Unit in a way that a Charge is an invalid Action?


Yes.

### Will I receive tokens if my cavalry unit uses a free Maneuver to move closer to the enemy and then charge them?

If the Cavalry unit could charge at the time of using the maneuver, yes. See the entry on “Activates” in the triggers and timing section.





### Will I receive tokens if I use an after Attack Action, such as the Swift Strike ability or a Surge Forth? 

No.




### Can I taunt a Unit that does not have line of sight to my unit, but can use an Attack ability to still attack, and give it tokens if it doesn’t? (such as Giant Spearthrowers)

Yes.
