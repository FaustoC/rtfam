# FUELED BY SLAUGHTER

### Does the "+1 additional Wounds for each of the Defender's destroyed ranks" mean only ranks destroyed by the Attack or in total?

Total, not just ranks destroyed by the Attack.





### Follow-up: If a unit is destroyed by the Attack, how many destroyed ranks does it have?


A unit has as many destroyed ranks as is shown on its tray (i.e. 3 ranks for Infantry trays, 2 for Cavalry trays, and 1 for Solo trays)
