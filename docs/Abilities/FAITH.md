# FAITH

### When exactly does the faith token get spent?


When resolving the effect, this effect is not voluntarily triggered.



###  If a unit no longer has a Faith ability, does it lose any Faith tokens?


No, you don't lose faith tokens. For example, if a unit loses its abilities, or a faith attachment is removed from the unit, any faith tokens remain on that unit.


### Can units without Faith abilities have faith tokens?


Yes. But faith tokens cannot be spent as long as that unit does not have a faith ability.




### If my army includes Beric Dondarrion - Azor Ahai (Faith Attachment) and Edric Dayne - Loyal Squire, when do those units gain Faith tokens?



Beric's unit gains a faith token when it passes a Morale Test. Edric's unit gains a faith token when it passes a Morale Test. Note that the exact wording is "Each time Beric's unit passes a Morale Test, it gains 1 Faith token.", where "it" refers to the unit passing the Morale Test. Edric's unit counts as Beric's unit through the ability "Beric's Vassal".




### FOLLOW-UP: Can Edric's unit gain Faith tokens, even if it does not have any Faith ability?


Yes.




### If a single unit has multiple Faith abilities, how many tokens does it gain when it passes a Morale Test?


It gains 1 token for each ability. Remember that a unit can't have more than 1 ability with the same name.



### FOLLOW-UP: If my army includes Beric (Faith attachment), a unit of R'hllor Faithful with Thoros (Commander) and Edric, and that unit passes a Morale Test, how many Faith tokens does it gain?



3.




###  If a unit has multiple Faith abilities, with how many Faith tokens does it start the game?



 A unit only ever begins the game with 1 Faith token.
