# TAKING A NEW NAME

###  If I replace this model with one that had an Order it had already used that Round, can I use that Order? What about Once-per game abilities or effects?

The model is treated exactly as it was prior in the Round, including used Orders/Abilities.


### If both players are using Jaqen H’ghar – Unnamed can they both use Order: Taking a New Name on the same destroyed attachment? 

Yes, they can both use it.  



### Follow up: Does an attachment taken by the tactics card Take the Black count as destroyed for the purposes of Jaqen H’ghar - Unnamed ability Order: Taking a New Name and vice-versa? 
Yes.
### Second follow up: Do copied attachments with an order that has been used earlier that round still count as being used even after being copied? 


Yes – it counts as being used so cannot be used again this round.
