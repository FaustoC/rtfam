# UNCONTROLLED RAGE

*Errata: Each time this unit Activates, if it can Charge an enemy, it performs 1 Morale Test. On a failure, it performs 1 Charge Action on the nearest valid enemy and counts as rolling a 6 for all Charge Distance Dice (this is their Action for the Turn).

###  Can a Cavalry unit with Uncontrolled Rage perform the free Maneuver Action first?

No. (See “Triggers and timing, “Activate” -CFAQ Ed)



### Can a unit combine Uncontrolled Rage with other ‘when a unit activates’ effects?

Yes. Note that all those effects come before a cavalry maneuver, per above.
