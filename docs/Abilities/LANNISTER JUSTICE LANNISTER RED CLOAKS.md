# LANNISTER JUSTICE (LANNISTER RED CLOAKS)


### Does this trigger multiple times during a Charge Action?

No. A Charge and its resulting Melee Attack are a single Action.


### Does the Maneuver Action granted by "Surge Forth" trigger "Lannister Justice" if you control [Crown]?

Yes, any Action triggers "Lannister Justice".

### What happens if the target of a Charge is destroyed, before the Charge Dice are rolled, as a result of "Lannister Justice"?

The unit performs the Charge but it's a Failed Charge no matter the result.


### Follow Up: If Lannister Red Cloaks charge an enemy, but destroy them first by Panic Test from Lannister Justice, the charge is automatically Failed. How do you proceed?


 As you don't have an enemy, you can't pivot, so you just move as much as you can (you must stop 1‚Äù away from units that you cannot go through) and then perform a Panic Test (due to Failed Charge).
