# A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game Community FAQ  

V. S05 1.6 (Feb 20, 2025) <br/>
This unofficial document contains a number of answers to ongoing unaddressed questions by official documentation by a dedicated team of volunteer competitive players and tournament judges spanning the globe. Additionally, the most recent official FAQ has been integrated into the document, for ease of use and navigation. You can find the official FAQ here.

Community questions asked and answered by the CFAQ team are bolded with the answers in regular formatting. Questions from the official FAQ document are marked with an asterisk (*) and are bolded, italic and underlined, with their answers in italic. 

It is important to note that the official answers do not appear in the same order or placement as in the official document, as we have added headers for each question in the general section for ease of search and navigation, (open document tabs!) Some answers from the official FAQ have had their grammar or spelling corrected where appropriate, or wording cleaned up. a few answers have been omitted as they are overruled by the community document.

As noted above, this FAQ is completely unofficial. It may be used by other events/groups as they see fit. If you have a question about how best to utilize this document, a rules question you believe needs to be addressed, have general feedback for the community rules team, or even just want to let us know how using it for your group went, you can reach us on the Online Circuit Discord  in the CFAQ channel, or you can email us at cfaq.asoiaf@gmail.com. Alternatively, you can find us out in the community!
