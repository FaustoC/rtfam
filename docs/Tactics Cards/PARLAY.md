# PARLAY

###  Can Parlay be combined with other “When a unit activates” effects that grant actions?

Yes. For example, Uncontrolled Rage has the same trigger and timing. A player can announce both abilities, and choose to resolve Uncontrolled Rage first. If they fail the subsequent morale test, they will make the charge into a unit resolving all charge and attack triggers. Once that ability is resolved, the player can choose to resolve Parlay.

NOTE: Cavalry maneuver is a different, later trigger, “at the start of activation”
