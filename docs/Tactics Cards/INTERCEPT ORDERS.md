# INTERCEPT ORDERS

###   If Intercept Orders is used on a unit affected by Rising Temperatures/Bribery/a similar effect, will that card be removed if the target is changed to another unit?

No. (The card stops the unit from ever being targeted -CFAQ Ed.) 


###  What does "If able" mean?


If there is another eligible target, it must be chosen. If there are no other eligible targets, the original unit remains the target (this interaction happens due to the specific trigger of this card in relation to resolving its actual effect, meaning this card could be played when no "other" eligible target actually exists).


###  Follow Up: How does Intercept Orders interact with Assault Orders (let's use Cotter Pyke's commander card as an example)? If there is only one unit capable of melee attack/charge will Intercept Orders have any effect?


No, Assault Orders are treated differently than the Combat zone because there is no optionality for performing an Attack on Assault Orders. Assault Orders state "X unit performs an Attack/charge," whereas in the Combat zone, it's "X unit may perform an Attack." Therefore, the target of Assault Orders can only be a Unit that can legally perform the action specified by the zone, while the target of the Combat zone (“Swords”) can be any Friendly Unit.



### How does Intercept Orders interact with Might of The Crown/Motivated By Coin/For The Watch and similar abilities?
