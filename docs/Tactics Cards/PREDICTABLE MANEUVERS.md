# PREDICTABLE MANEUVERS

### If I declare an Action that is subsequently made invalid by my opponent's Predictable Maneuvers card, do I lose that Action?

Yes.


### When do you declare the friendly target unit that performs the action in part two of the effect? 

When you declare the enemy targets, you also declare the friendly recipients. (declare all targets before resolving the card).
