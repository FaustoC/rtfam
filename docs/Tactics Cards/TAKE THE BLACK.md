# TAKE THE BLACK

###  How does this interact with effects that return Characters to units and/or redeploy the unit?
 A copy of the Character would remain in the Night's Watch unit.


###  If you use Sadistic Mutilation to destroy an attachment, can you use Take The Black on that same attack to take that destroyed attachment?
No. Attachments must be destroyed by the attack itself for Take The Black to be able to take it.
