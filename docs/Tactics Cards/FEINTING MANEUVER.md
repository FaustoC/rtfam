# FEINTING MANEUVER

###  If my target has effects that trigger from being Charged from the Front/Flank (such as Set for Charge), do they trigger?
No. the unit is treated as having been charged in the Flank/Rear respectively for all gameplay purposes.

###  If I use Feinting Maneuver, and my unit “lands” on a terrain piece in its final spot, does my unit count as being in / moving through / charging through that terrain? 
Yes.

###  Follow Up: What about terrain in between the spot of contact and final alignment, that I never touch?
No.
