# HARSH CONDITIONS

###  Who chooses which Abilities are lost?

The player who played Harsh Conditions.



### Can you provide clarity on how the tactics card  Harsh Conditions works on abilities with multiple rules/effects? 

A: An abilities effect is everything included in the text box under the header – this is true for both Combat Unit and Attachment abilities. Some abilities are made up of multiple other abilities/rules. 
Examples:

Lannister Crossbowmen have one ability - Crossbow. It is one ability made up of multiple abilities/rules. You could expend one condition token when playing the tactics card Harsh Conditions to nullify everything included in the text box.  

In this second example House Clegane Mountain’s Men have two abilities: Marauder’s Blades and Prey on Fear. you would need to expend two condition tokens when playing the tactics card Harsh Conditions to remove all of their abilities.
