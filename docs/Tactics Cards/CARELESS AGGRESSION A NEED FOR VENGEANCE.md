# CARELESS AGGRESSION/A NEED FOR VENGEANCE

### Does the owner of this card control the secondary effect of the enemy activating an NCU for simultaneous effects purposes? If they play Coordinated Plotting for example, may that player resolve Coordinated Plotting before the enemy activates the NCU?

Yes, it follows simultaneous effects rules. If they are the active player in the round, they may declare and resolve any other after attack effects before their opponent activates their NCU.
