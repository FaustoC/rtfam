# MIND GAMES

###  If a player plays Mind Games, and their opponent claims the target zone but replaces its effect when claiming it. Does the first player resolve the original zone effect or the replacement effect?


 The original zone effect.


### When copying the effect of a zone using Mind Games, how does targeting work?


The zone's effect targets following the normal rules for that zone.


### Follow Up: Does using that zone effect count as being that zone for cards like Bribery or Rising Temperatures?

Yes. Treat it as though you had claimed the zone with an NCU and were resolving the zone as normal. Note: you do not control that zone from this card's effect.
