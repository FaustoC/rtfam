# COORDINATION TACTICS

###  If a unit gains an Order via the card Coordination Tactics, is it always available to use, even if the Order was already used this round on the unit being copied from?

Yes.


### If a unit loses its abilities, can those abilities be copied to another unit via Coordination Tactics?

 If they lost an ability, that ability cannot be copied.




### Does an unused order gained by the Coordination Tactics card (or any other similar ability/card) used by the second unit that turn, affect the original unit’s ability to use the order for the rest of the round? 

No - the original unit can still use the copied order later in the round.  




### Can I use the Coordination Tactics card in my opponent's turn and then trigger a “start of a friendly turn” order? 

No. The tactics card Coordination Tactics does not provide an exception for using a “start of a friendly turn” order in your opponent's turn. 




###  If a Unit gains an effect that references a source, such as a card or tokens, the new unit does not have, can the effect still be utilized (Such as Pillage or Names on the List)?

No. The unit gaining the effect would need to have the source, you may not utilize the original units resources to turn on the effect for the new unit.
