# REGROUP AND REFORM

###  When using this card to switch 2 friendly attachments, do you have to obey usual attachment restrictions? Example: Unit A has Harmaâ€™s Bannerman as a second attachment, and Unit B has only the Weeper, are they prevented from switching because Weeper does not ignore attachment rules?


No, the restriction is specifically stated for moving an attachment, not when switching two attachments.
