# UNSTOPPABLE ADVANCE

### If a unit is performing a Charge Action and they roll a 1 on their Charge Distance Dice. Can I still play Unstoppable Advance from my hand to re-roll the dice?


Yes.






### How do I resolve the second header (Surges Forth) with the ‘declare all targets of Tactics Cards … before resolution’ rules text

 Pre-measure the ending location of the maneuver, then declare targets for the card. If your opponent cancels the effect of the card based on those targets (say with A Flayed Man Has No Secrets) you may instead do a different maneuver.
