# DEVIOUS METHODS

###  If this takes a card that, upon being played, would attach to a unit, what happens?

The card is returned to the opponent's discard pile if it leaves your hand for any reason.



### How does this card interact with cards that would deploy units?

 If the Greyjoy player has the listed unit available, it may be deployed.
