# CANCELED ABILITIES AND TACTICS CARDS

### If a portion of an ability or effect is canceled, does the entire effect get canceled?

Yes. You cancel the entire ability/effect.






### If an Order is declared, but then canceled by another effect. Is that Order available to be used in that Round on another instance of that trigger?

No.




### How is “canceling once per game abilities” interpreted? Qhorin is specified in the official FAQ. How about Tywin, Tycho, etc.? If you cancel them, can they be used again later, or is it spent?

If an ability that is not an order or tactic card is canceled, the whole effect of it is canceled, including any spending of resources –  Once Per Game abilities remain unused, Qhorin remains alive, any tokens spent during resolution (Wendamyr NCU, Cortney Penrose NCU) are not spent.




###  If a tactics card is declared, but then canceled by another effect. Does that tactics card return to the player's hand?

No. The card is discarded.
