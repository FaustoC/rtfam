# TACTICS ZONES

#### How long does the effect of abilities that state "Replace a Zone's effect" last?

Until the claiming of that zone on that instance is resolved, unless stated otherwise.


#### Do Abilities such as Orders of the Crown or Motivated by Coin, which trigger when a unit is targeted by a specific zone, trigger if a different zone gains the listed zone's effect?

No. The trigger for these effects is the unit being targeted by the specific zone listed on the Ability- it is not linked to the effect of that zone.
