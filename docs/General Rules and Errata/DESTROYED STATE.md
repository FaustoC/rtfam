# DESTROYED STATE

### If a unit would be destroyed after the "Defender Rolls Defense Dice" but stays alive as a part of an ability, order or Tactics card (e.g., Last Stand), does it suffer the Panic Test triggered as part of the Attack suffered?


Yes.

### Can units that are Destroyed perform actions?

Community errata, at Pg. 7 of the manual replace :  

“When the last Wound is lost from a unit, it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.”

With :

“When the last Wound is lost from a unit, it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield. Destroyed units may not perform actions unless that action is specifically granted by an ability or effect.”
