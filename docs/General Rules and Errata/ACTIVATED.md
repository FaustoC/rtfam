# Activated

### What happens if a Unit is unactivated, but I can’t activate them? 

Community Errata, Rulebook Pg. 6. **"...until all units have been activated"**
Replace with:  **"...until no player is able to activate a Unit"**


### When exactly is a Unit considered activated? 

The moment it is chosen to activate. The rulebook mentions on page 13 that a Unit is given an Activation token at the end of the unit's Action (or forgo of) to mark that the activation **has ended**. There is no specific wording in regards when a Unit is considered “Activated”. Logically, a Unit is considered activated the moment it is chosen to activate.
