# ATTACHMENTS

#### Are Scorpion Modifications Attachment Cards, or merely Attached cards?

They are merely Attached cards.



#### If an Attachment is destroyed or somehow removed from a unit, does the unit lose the Abilities of the Attachment?

Yes.




#### If an Attachment is destroyed or somehow removed from a unit, does the unit lose the Abilities of the Attachment?

Yes.




#### If my opponent has an Attachment that is added to my unit (such as Jaqen H'ghar, Unnamed), and that unit already contains an Attachment, how is the order determined?

The unit's owner determines the order in which they are placed within the unit.




#### Follow-up: So this means if the unit is dealt enough Wounds to remove that Attachment, but not destroy the unit, the Attachment is removed (and thus its Ability lost)?

Yes.


#### If an Attachment is destroyed from a unit, and then wounds are restored to the unit, can the Attachment be returned?

No. Once destroyed, the Attachment is permanently lost. The unit may only restore generic models.

# ATTACHMENTS “IGNORING USUAL ATTACHMENT LIMITS”

#### When effects say to “ignore usual attachment limits”, what exactly is ignored? 

The limit of 1 attachment per unit, as well as standard list building rules of point limit and faction. You DO NOT ignore the unit type restrictions ( the attachment must still be of the same unit type they are being added to ).
