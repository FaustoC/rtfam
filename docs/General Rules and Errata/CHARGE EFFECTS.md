# CHARGE EFFECTS

#### When charging with the resulting attack replaced with auto hits, such as Ride Them Down and Overconfidence, does my unit benefit from charge effects with the sword icon next to it such as Ambush and Coordinated Assault? 

Yes. For various reasons including previous FAQs, the sword icon seems to be a reminder symbol to catch a playerâ€™s eye while playing, and not strict in ruling the connected effect as only happening during a melee attack.
