# MOVEMENT/SHIFTS

#### Can I move and/or pivot off the table edge?

Units may pivot off the table edge, but may not do any other type of movement. The table edge is treated as impassable.

#### Is Shift affected by movement penalties (such as Rough Keyword)?

Yes.

#### Can I Shift while engaged?

No.

#### Can a unit Shift into range when it makes a Ranged Attack, or must it already have a valid target within range to begin with?

A target must be valid after the Shift. This effectively means units with Long Range can initiate Ranged Attacks from 14", and Short Range 8".
