# CONDITION TOKENS

### Can I, by any means, change one Condition token to another one that the unit already has?

Yes, and that would result on the unit not being able to gain a second token of the same type.






### Can I expend Condition tokens while also utilizing other effects with similar timing?

Yes.




### Can a Condition token be placed on an NCU?


No.
