# DUPLICATE NAMED ATTACHMENTS

#### What happens in a situation, where a destroyed attachment is brought back using Moqorro NCU, and then, using Balon NCU, the whole unit that contained that attachment is brought back?

In that scenario, there would be 2 instances of that attachment on the battlefield (1 brought by Moqorro, 1 by Balon).
