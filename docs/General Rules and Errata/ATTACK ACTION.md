# ATTACK ACTION REFACE/REPOSITION INTO OTHER ENEMY UNITS

#### When my unit chooses to reposition when performing a melee attack, can it end up within one inch of an enemy unit not engaged with it? Can it end up contacting that unit perfectly thus resulting in engaging a new unit?

**Community Errata**: You ignore the 1" rule when aligning a unit during a melee attack. You may not align into contact with units not previously engaged in combat with your unit.
