# CHARGE ACTION

### When I declare a Charge, do I have to declare the target right away?

Yes. The target of a Charge is declared when declaring the Charge itself, before resolving. 

### When I declare a Charge, is the current arc my unit starts in, the arc I must align to? 

Almost always yes, but Determining line of sight arc is also step 1 of resolving the Charge Action. Something like Quaithe NCU can change which arc you align to from the moment of declaring the charge to when you resolve the charge. (This is the Suplex ban -Evan)

### If, when charged, a Unit retreats before it is attacked as part of that charge, (such as in the case of ‘Set For Charge’ into ‘Hit And Run’) can the charging unit’s attack still be resolved against the defender?

No. The attack as part of a charge cannot be performed if the charged unit is no longer engaged in combat with the charging unit.

### Can a unit that failed its Charge finish the Charge movement within 1" of an enemy unit?

Yes.
