# ORDER TOKENS ON NON COMBAT UNITS (NCU)

#### Are NCU abilities that use order tokens to mark the number of uses remaining (such as Lord Varys – The Spider’s ability Little Birds) order abilities? 

No – abilities are not orders unless explicitly state they are an order, Example: Order: Set For Charge
