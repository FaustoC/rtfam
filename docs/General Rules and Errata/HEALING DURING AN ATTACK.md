# HEALING DURING AN ATTACK

#### Do you count wounds healed before the attack sequence completes for the purposes of wounds dealt and ranks destroyed by an Attack?  

You count all wounds and ranks destroyed caused by the attack when determining effects regardless of whether they were healed before the attack was completed.
