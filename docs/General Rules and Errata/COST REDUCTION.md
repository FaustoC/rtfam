# COST REDUCTION

#### If I have multiple things that are eligible for a point cost reduction on my list which has its cost reduced?

Cost reductions always apply to the first eligible item sequentially to be reduced in your list. It is the players responsibility to order their list appropriately. (So for example, The first dragon placed in your list with Daenerys the Unburnt)
